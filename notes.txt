* We use in uncontrolled form useRef hooks.
* It is like useState but it don't rerender the page.

*** Syntax ===> const variable_name = useRef(initial_value);

*** onSubmit needs to use to submit the form no needs of value and onChange field.
    onSubmit(function)


    //define anywhere the function
    in that function pass event

    //and for prevent the form behaviour
    event.preventDefault();


    ref_variable.current.value;
